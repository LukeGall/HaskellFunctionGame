# HaskellFunctionGame
A small haskell guessing game where you give it a function working on two parameters can try to guess which combonation would return zero. This was made to learn more Haskell for one of my Uni courses

Can be run by downloading the file and then using GHCi to play the game after providing a function and the number of guesses
